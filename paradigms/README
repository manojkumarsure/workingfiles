ODD14 CS3100 - Paradigms of Programming                                       Programming Assignment 1
*******************************************************************************************************

           Details

matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt contain the two matrices for testing
expressions.txt contains the expressions to be evaluated
answer1.txt and answers2.txt contain the answers for all the expressions for the corresponding matrices 

*******************************************************************************************************

          Evaluation method

matrix_file and the expression_file will be given through the command line. 
The output should be printed to the screen one after the other with 
an extra newline in between as given in the sample test case.

*******************************************************************************************************

          Submission instruction

Submit a single tarball/zip file containing a single folder(name: ROLLNO) that contains all 
the files including a Makefile. 
Use the following naming convention: ’rollno.tar.gz’ with all capital letters. Ex:CS12B043.tar.gz
Naming the files is left to your convention. But a Makefile is a must.
The makefile on being run, should produce the executable file named "evaluate" (without quotes).
The following commands when run should output the answers to the screen in the 
same pattern as given in the sample test cases.

$make
$./evaluate matrix_filename expression_filename
