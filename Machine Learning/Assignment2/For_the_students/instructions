Step1: Feature Extraction
--------------------------
You are given a set of scene images. In this step, the requirement is to extract some features from the images that can be used as input to our SVM. 
There are many feature extraction techniques. For this assignment, we will follow a color histogram based approach. 
This is not the best technique for feature extraction, but most likely, the easiest. 
    How to: (matlab)
    --------
1. Read the image into a variable using imread(). Eg: im=imread('filename')
2. Extract red, green and blue channels from the variable you read into in 1. The sequence is r-g-b. Eg: r=im(:,:,1)
3. For every channel divide it into 32 bins and find frequency using imhist(). Eg. f1=imhist(r,32)
4. Concatenate these 32 dimensional feature vectors for every channel to find a 96D vector for the whole image. (sequence r-g-b)

Step2: Classification
----------------------
Use the training data to build classification models using the following kernels.
1. Linear kernel
2. Polynomial kernel
3. Gaussian kernel
4. Sigmoid kernel
5. Histogram intersection kernel

Come up with the kernel parameters for the various models. 
You can use a fraction of data supplied to do a n-fold cross validation to find the best model parameters.
